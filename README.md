## Project Timeline

You have exactly one month to complete the ShieldFi insurance protocol project, beginning on October 27th and concluding on November 26th. The final deadline for all code submissions is Wednesday, November 26th at 11:59 PM. 

Throughout this development period, you'll be working in your own branch and regularly pushing your progress. When you've completed the project or reached a significant milestone, you'll create a pull request to submit your work for review. 

Please note that no further commits will be accepted after the November 26th deadline, so plan your development schedule accordingly to ensure you have enough time for testing and final adjustments. This timeline gives you four full weeks to build, test, and refine your implementation while balancing learning with practical development.

Happy building! 🛡️
